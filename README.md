## Sales Database
sales-db includes a database class used to fetch, insert, and make tables as well as special functionality needed to retrieve previous sales data needed to inference the machine learning model.

## Sales Model
sales-model includes the notebook used to train, test, and save the machine learning model. It also includes the saved model, and an image of the model architecture.
